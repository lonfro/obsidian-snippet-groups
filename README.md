# Known Issues:
- Using [Obsidian Settings Search](https://github.com/javalent/settings-search) with a delay on [Lazy Plugin Loader](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins) causes settings modal to refresh, removing the plugin's effects. Simply reopnening the appearance tab fixes this.
